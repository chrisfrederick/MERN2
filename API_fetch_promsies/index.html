<!-- What did we just do? 
First, we created a request to the endpoint "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon" via fetch. 
If you were to copy this into an html file yourself and then open it, 
you would see the Pokemon response in the Javascript console. 
Using fetch is a very easy way to get a simple request going in your html file. -->
